# Algorithms-Kotlin

### Work In Progress (90% completed)

This is a port of the famous Princeton Algorithms course (https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/).
The original course and the helper library (https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4) are written in Java.

**Note: This port has everything implemented from scratch. The implementations may not be as optimal as the source.**

This port has 3 parts: 
1. Helper library (algs4.jar) in Kotlin - 90% completed
2. Solutions to problems in Kotlin - 90% completed
3. Tests for the above two points (including perf benchmarks) - 90% completed

### Instructions

Coming soon.
